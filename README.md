# CWDSDK
CWDSDK (C' Web Development Software Development Kit) is a program that uses a VM (CSDKVM) and a compiler (CSDKC) to create a web development system that can be closed source without needing to set up a web server using Node.JS or similar applications. 

(Used to be called CSDK (C' Sorce Development Kit) until I found out that the name was trademarked by Oracle Corporation (Client SDK), I do NOT wanna mess with them, especially with trademarks, so I changed it to CWDSDK. )

This project uses an open source software called p5.js (https://p5js.org/), which is in no way mine and is used in this project.

1/5/2021 - Working on CWDSDKVM, CSDKC has not been planned out yet and might be discontinued at a later date, but hopefully not. 

1/6/2021 - Moved different parts of program to multiple files for orginization. 

Also 1/6/2021 - Changed the name so I don't get sued.
